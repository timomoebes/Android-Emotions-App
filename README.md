# Android Emotions App

Think of the Android Emotions App as a game on your phone. When you tell the game how you feel, it answers you and asks you a new question to help you feel better or chat more about your feelings. It's like a little friend in your phone that can talk to you and ask you questions depending on how you're feeling!
